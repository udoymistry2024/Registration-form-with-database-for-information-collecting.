# Dynamic Registration Form & Admin Panel

This is a comprehensive web application built with PHP and MySQL that provides a dynamic, user-friendly registration system. The core feature of this project is a powerful admin panel that allows the site owner to fully customize the registration form, manage users, and view all submitted data without writing any code.

The system is designed with security in mind, featuring a one-time owner setup, a secure password recovery mechanism using unique security codes, and an invitation-only system for adding new administrators.

## ✨ Key Features (প্রধান বৈশিষ্ট্যসমূহ)

-   **Dynamic Form Management:** The owner can add or remove fields (text, email, file, etc.) for the registration form directly from the admin panel.
-   **Secure Admin Panel:** The entire admin area is protected by a robust login system.
-   **Owner & Admin Roles:** The first user to sign up becomes the "Owner" with full privileges, including the ability to invite other "Admins".
-   **One-Time Owner Signup:** The initial signup process is available only once to establish the primary owner account.

-   **Invitation-Only Admin Signup:** New administrators can only be added via single-use invitation codes generated by the owner.
-   **Data Update/Replacement:** If a user submits the form again with the same unique identifiers (e.g., Roll Number & Email), the old data is automatically replaced with the new submission.
-   **Image Preview & Download:** Admins can view uploaded images in full size and download them directly from the dashboard.
-   **Fully Responsive Design:** Both the registration form and the admin panel are designed to work seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## 📖 How to Use (ব্যবহারবিধি)

### 1. First-Time Setup (Owner Account Creation)
-   When you first visit the `login.php` page, the system will detect that no admin exists and will automatically redirect you to `signup.php`.
-   Create your owner account by choosing a username and password.
-   After successful signup, you will be shown **5 unique 4-digit security codes**.
-   **WARNING:** Save these codes in a very secure place. They are the only way to recover your password if you forget it. You will not be shown these codes again.
-   Click "Proceed to Login".

### 2. Admin Login
-   Use the username and password you just created to log in to the admin panel.

### 3. Managing the Registration Form (ফর্ম ম্যানেজমেন্ট)
-   Navigate to **Manage Fields** from the sidebar.
-   Here you can see the list of current form fields.
-   You can **delete** existing fields or **add new fields** using the form at the bottom. The changes will instantly reflect on the main registration form.
-   Navigate to **Settings** to change the main title of the registration form.

### 4. Inviting a New Admin (User)
-   As the **Owner**, navigate to **Manage Users**.
-   Click the **"Generate New Invite Code"** button.
-   A new, unique, single-use code will appear in the table.
-   Copy this code and share it with the person you want to invite as an admin.

### 5. New Admin Signup
-   The new user goes to the `login.php` page.
-   They click on the **"Sign Up with Invite Code"** link.
-   They enter the invitation code you provided, along with their desired username and password, to create their account.

### 6. Password Recovery (For Owner Only)
-   If you (the owner) forget your password, go to the `login.php` page and click **"Forgot Password?"**.
-   You will need to enter your username and one of the 5 security codes you saved during signup to set a new password.
